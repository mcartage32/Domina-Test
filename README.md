# Domina-Test

## General Considerations

1. The frontend will run by default on port 5173 and the backend API will run on port 3000. Make sure you have these ports free or if you wish you can change these ports in the respective files.

Before installing this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

1. **MySQL 9.0.1** or any later version.
2. **Node.js 22.13.1** or any later version.

**Note:** To run this project, you must ensure that MySQL is running on port 3306, the root user is "root", and the corresponding password is "root". You must also create an empty database with the name "domina_test". However, if you want to change the database configuration, remember to modify the file `/backend/app.module.ts` so that the REST API connects correctly with the database.
